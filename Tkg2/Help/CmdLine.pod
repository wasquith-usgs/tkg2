Tkg2 -- An innovative and unique 2-D charting program. 

% USAGE:

         tkg2 [ options ] [ Tkg2filename(s) ]
            Most common way to run Tkg2.
            
         Tkg2filename(s) [ options ] 
            The Tkg2 file names will spawn the Tkg2 program for you
            assuming that Tkg2 is found at /usr/local/bin/Tkg2.
       
% HELP:

         Each Tkg2 sheet provides a HELP menu on the far right hand side.
         Various help topics can be accessed via the command line (see
         --help option below).  This command line help can be found at
         /usr/local/Tkg2/Help/CmdLine.pod or spooled to the default
         printer from the HELP menu.
         
% QUICKTIP:
  
  Perform the following command: Tkg2 -mktemp=p
  Tkg2 starts up, creates a portrait sheet, creates a single plot, and
  is now prompting you for a data file to read in.

% TUTORIAL

  Mouse Control
  The Tkg2 mouse presently has some slightly different than expected
  behaviors compared to other graphical user interfaces.  This is
  primarily because your author has not figured out how to get Tk to
  reliably distinguish between single and double clicks etc. The
  general rule is that if the left or first button (Button-1) does not
  do what you expect or want, try the right or third button (Button-3).

  Mouse use primer:
     o Menus --
           All use Button-1.

     o Plots --
           Grab, Move, and Release using Button-3.  A double click
             with the button might be required as the mouse event
             listener sometimes miss them for unknown reasons.
           Select, Resize with Button-1.
           Launch the PlotEditor with a Double-Button-1.

     o Explanation --
           Grab, Move, and Release using Button-3.
           Edit individual text entries with Double-Button-1.
           Edit individual symbology with Double-Button-1.

     o Axis --
           Launch x, y, or y2 axis editors by Double-Button-1.

     o Annotation --
        Symbols and Text
           Grab, Move, and Release using Button-1.
           Edit and Delete with Double-Button-3.
        Lines
           Select, Resize by nodes, Release with Button-1.
           Edit and Delete with Double-Button-3.

% COMMAND LINE OPTIONS         
  The following command line options are available to more precisely
  control Tkg2 behavior and provide many powerful batch processing and
  application control and development features.  The options are longer
  in character length than those commonly seen in other packages.  This
  is done for at least two reasons.  Most of the options will be used
  by calling scripts--verbose options help to self document those
  scripts.  Long options have a greater name space and hence are less
  likely to change in the future.  Fortunately, options can be
  abbreviated or shortened to the minimum number of starting letters 
  for that option to be unique.
  
  Several options are mutually exclusive--for example, when --help is
  applied all other options are ignored.  These are identified with a
  '**' after the option name.  When a '?' follows an option value then
  the value is optional and Tkg2 provides a default value.  Any
  suggestions for further options are greatly encouraged.  Many of the
  options are closely link to parameter settings in the Tkg2rc files, see
  Tkg2/Tkg2rc.pod for further details.

     --autoexit or --autoexit=<integer>
           Automatically exits after all pending Tkg2 files are
           processed.  If an integer argument is provided, then
           Tkg2 will sleep for that many seconds before performing
           the autoexit.  This can be a useful feature if you
           want to quickly look at some Tkg2 files and then go
           back to the command line.  This is also a handy feature
           for your author as the development-test cycle is
           slightly faster if the mouse is not required to 
           quit the application.

     --batch 
           Starts Tkg2 in a batch processing input-output mode.
           The main dialog box is not shown.  The menus, rulers,
           and scrollbars are not generated during the session.  The
           default behavior of --batch is to spool each of the *.Tkg2
           files to the default printer.  The printer destination is
           controlled using the --destination option.  If a postscript
           file is desired instead, use the --exportfile=file option
           with --format=ps.  The colormode of the postscript is
           controlled using the --colormode option.  The Tkg2 files
           will be shown on the screen unless the --withdraw option
           is used too.  The --batch option uses --autoexit behind
           the scenes so there is no need to include --autoexit.
           Note, that the undo is turned off when running under
           --batch to get just a bit more speed out of the
           application.
     
     --batchsave
           All opened Tkg2 files are automatically saved.  This is
           a neat feature to help scripters of Tkg2 to bring their
           templates to the current version.  The most common usage
           is to incorporate --withdraw, --verbose, --autoexit, and
           --glob.  For example:
             % tkg2 -withdraw -verbose -a -glob -batchsave
           All *.Tkg2 files in the current directory will be saved
           in the current version.
           
     --checkcolors
           Checking the system colors is advisable when you first
           begin using Tkg2.  At runtime, Tkg2 looks at a
           configuration file Tkg2/Tkg2rc for default colors and
           in a \$HOME/.Tkg2rc file for additional colors.  These
           color names are checked against the rgb.txt file--
           Tkg2 is coded to look for it in the usual OS dependent
           places--on the host system to see if they are valid.
           Color names that are not found are removed.  However,
           a bigger problem is that the colors might be valid on
           the host system but not valid on the client.  Thus, Tk
           must actually perform an evaluation.  For example, NT
           boxes using Reflection X do not have the color lightgreen,
           yet the Sun boxes do.  The --checkcolors option checks this
           out, reports, and removes the color.  Still another problem
           is that a *.Tkg2 file created on one system might request
           colors that are not available on another system.  The
           --fixcolors opion will change all nonvalid colors in a
           *.Tkg2 file to black.
           
     --clear
           Clears the terminal screen before execution begins.  Why?
           Because it was easy to do.
           
     --colormode=<color | mono>
           Set the postscript color mode in either color or mono.
           There might be a bug with the greyscale option that is
           makes it invalid for Tk.  Color mode is 'color' when unless
           specified differently.
           
     --cycle=<integer --test>
           --cycle sets the number of times that --test is to cycle
           through and display the *.Tkg2 files.  This option is
           available on only inconjunction with --test.  The integer
           is mandatory.  This is handy as one can have Tkg2
           cycling through example plots before a presentation
           or training session gets underway.
           
     --debug=<stdout | file> 
           Toggle the built-in reporting mechanism for Tkg2.  If
           --debug=stdout, then debug messages printed along STDOUT
           through the BUGS filehandle.  When --debug equals 'file'
           then debug messages are appended to /tmp/Tkg2.bugs.  Debug
           is an under implemented feature, but can be helpful in some
           situations.  See --verbose and --showme.
           
     --destination=<printer>
           Printer destination.  The default printer is used when
           unspecified.  'lpstat -d' is used to determine the default
           printer and 'lpstat -v' is used to determine the list of
           available printers.  Of course lpstat is only used on 
           those systems that support it.  If your system does not
           then you will have to rely on the Tkg2rc files.
           
     --display=[host]:server[.screen] or
     --DISPLAY=[host]:server[.screen]
           The display that Tkg2 is to operate under can be changed
           if and only if --display is the very first command line
           option.  Tkg2 requires some special internal handling
           of display before the other command line options can be
           processed.  Using --display allows variations on the
           following remote shell application:
             % tkg2 -stdout -withdraw -autoexit -importdata \
             tkg2file.tkg2 | rsh server.domain \
             "tkg2 -display=local:0.0 -stdin"
           This is a clear example of the shear power provided by
           simple redirection of STDOUT and STDIN channels, and
           why all good software should have both graphical and
           commandline interfaces.
     
     --dnload_data  **                   NOT IMPLEMENTED YET
           Dumps data from *.tkg2 files after any necessary dynamic
           loading in a DataDumper format.
     
     --drawdata or --nodrawdata
           Turn on or turn off whether the data portion of the plots
           in a given Tkg2 file are to be redrawn.  If the option
           is not given then the data is drawn with each update on
           the canvas.  If the Tkg2 file is saved or printed then
           the data is drawn regardless of the presence of
           --nodrawdata.  Also at the first rendering of the
           Tkg2 file on the screen the data is drawn although the
           --nodrawdata option is set.  The data is not drawn on
           subsequent updates of the canvas.
     
     --dumpboxes
           Dump the statistics of each box plot to standard out.
           Tkg2 boxplot capabilities are really powerful and utilize
           a bunch of common and uncommon statistical measures of
           the data including the incredible L-moments.
           
           Each time a box plot is generated the statistics of the
           data set are echoed to standard output when --dumpboxes
           is used.  Tkg2 can be turned into a powerful statistical
           computing tool when --dumpboxes is used with its batch
           processing, instruction capabilities, and your own calling
           scripts to pick up the dumped statistics for use elsewhere.
           The following is an example of the statistics dumped:
           BEGIN BOX DUMP:
                  -geometric_mean => 0.0456646656601944
                  -harmonic_mean => 0.00740680625704875
                  -kurtosis => undef
                  -lower_centacile => undef
                  -lower_decile => 0.00324416839535917
                  -lower_detection_limit => undef
                  -lower_pentacile => 0.0135160324480734
                  -lower_quartile => 0.0248795878523217
                  -lower_replace_value => undef
                  -lower_tercile => 0.0612532373355434
                  -max => 9.449
                  -mean => 0.329944162436548
                  -median => 0.050
                  -min => 0.001
                  -moment_calc_method => product
                  -number_samples => 197
                  -scale => 1.02161070400605
                  -skew => 7.11001700943568
                  -type1_outliers => 1.609,1.665,1.767,1.874
                  -type2_outliers => 3.167,3.435,8.967,9.449
                  -upper_centacile => undef
                  -upper_decile => 1.8631064653856
                  -upper_detection_limit => undef
                  -upper_pentacile => 1.03825954469415
                  -upper_quartile => 0.830952363155337
                  -upper_replace_value => undef
                  -upper_tercile => 0.598635087537553
           END BOX DUMP:            
           Brief details about some of the statistics are required.
           Further information can be determined from the DrawDataEditor
           (double click on the symbology in the explanation).
           -scale = standard deviation when product moments are used.
           -scale = L-scale when L-moments are used.
           All upper and lower 'ciles are computed using order statistics.
           Outliers have differing meanings depending upon user definition.
           
           Postprocessing of just simple observation of this output
           could be cumbersome because the BEGIN BOX DUMP: is not able
           to provide information about which box etc.  The --message
           option can be used to replace BEGIN BOX DUMP: with
           'Statistics for --message\n' in which --message is the 
           string provided by the option.  This is handy because you
           can do mass batch processing, spool continuous output
           to a line printer, and use the message as a way to look
           at the output and know something about what data the
           statistics shown are for.  When the --message is present
           the END BOX DUMP: is not shown.
     
     --echocommandline
           Echos the command line back to the user, including the
           Tkg2 executable.
     
     --exportfile[v]=<filename>
           Export file name, whose --format can be either 
           FrameMaker Interchange (MIF), Portable Document Format (PDF)
           Portable Network Graphics (png), or Postscript (PS).
           The exportfile will overwrite a prior file.  The addition
           of the 'v' at the end of the option instructs Tkg2 to
           launch the appropriate external viewing utility.  This
           can be very helpful in debugging the calls to the image
           generation software.  If a file name is not provided, then
           the base name of the Tkg2 file is used and a ".ps"
           extension is added.  All Tkg2 files provided on the command
           line will be exported.
           
     --exportrotate=<0 | 90>
           Controls the direction or orientation of the page. 
           For example, by default 11x8.5 pages are set
           to landscape, which just means to rotate the image
           90 degrees counter clockwise.
     
     --exportview=<integer, pixels per inch>?
           Instructs Tkg2 to launch the appropriate external viewing
           utility.  This option is ignored unless --exportfile[v] is
           used too.  The optional integer of pixels per inch sets the
           scale or resolution of the view of the postscript output.
           The viewing of the non-postscript export formats is not 
           affected by the resolution.  Ghostscript is used to view
           the postscript output and --exportview provides the value
           for the Ghostscript '-r' argument.  See gs manpage for more
           details.  If the resolution is left off the value used
           for postscript view is 50.  Use smaller values to view pages
           significantly larger than letter size.  This option is
           a critical element of debugging image exporting.
           
     --fixcolors **                      NOT IMPLEMENTED YET
           Will change all nonvalid colors in a *.tkg2 file to black.
   
     --format=< (mif|MIF) | (pdf|PDF) | (png|PNG) | (ps|PS) >
           The default is postscript (PS) if not specified.  The MIF
           format requires the external utility pstoedit.  pstoedit
           requires Ghostscript.  The PDF and PNG rendering is performed
           by Ghostscript.  An --autoexit is implied by --format.
           
           Each of the formats can take on additional arguments as
           described below.  The syntax for giving additional arguments
           is to separate each with a colon, ':', after the format type
           has been given.  If the first argument is the word 'ask' a
           file browser dialog box is launched; tkg2 will exit with a 
           message if the Cancel button is pressed unless the type is MIF
           in which a quiet exit is made.  Additional arguments after the
           : are explained below.

           It can be useful to --verbose Tkg2 and see the sequence of 
           external commands and utilities that construct the export formats.
                          
             MIF:  Framemaker Interchange Format (not on Win32 or MacOSX)
                   --format=mif
                             
             PNG:  Portable Network Graphics (PNG is Not GIF)
                   --format=png [:ask[:resolution]]
                             The pixels per inch count, which can be
                             used for fine tuning the PNG output.
                             tkg2 -format=png::250 yourplot.tkg2
                               yourplot.png is produced at 250 pixels per inch.
                             tkg2 -format=png:ask:300 yourplot.tkg2
                               Prompt for the png file at 300 pixels per inch.
             
             PDF:  Portable Document Format
                   --format=pdf [:ask[:zoom factor]]
                             The zoom factor is a multiplier on the
                             pixels per inch setting on the PDF
                             generation, which can be used
                             for fine tuning the PDF output.
                             tkg2 -format=pdf:ask yourplot.tkg2
                               Prompt for the pdf file with multiplier of 1.
                             tkg2 -format=pdf yourplot.tkg2
                               yourplot.pdf generated.
                             tkg2 -format=pdf::2 yourplot.tkg2
                               yourplot.pdf generated with a 2 multiplier.
             
             PS:   Postscript
                   --format=ps
                        This is the default format.  Only :ask is available.
            
           If the format is specified and the --exportfile is not,
           then the Tkg2 file extension is dropped and .ps, .pdf, .png,
           or .mif is added to the file, which avoids clobbering your
           hard Tkg2 work.
      
     --geometry=<'valid unix geometry string'>
           Control the window size and screen location of the Tkg2 sheet
           with this option.  The main Tkg2 dialog or presenter dialog
           are not controllable.  The format for the string is the usual
           X-windows geometry string (\d+[x]\d+[+-]\d+[+-]\d+).  The '\d+'
           denotes an integer.  The [x] is the character x and [+-]
           indicates the plus or minus sign.  Here are some examples:
             --geometry=300x450
                300 pixel width and 450 pixel height
                
             --geometry=45x300-100+20
                45 pixels by 300 pixels placed 100 pixels from left
                and 20 pixels down from top.
               
             --geometry=+100-20
                Default width and height placed 100 pixels from right
                and 20 pixels up from bottom.
           Some variation on whether you will detect the effects of the
           geometry depend on the window manager that you are using and
           the natural size of the Tkg2 sheet.
           
     --glob=<'pattern'>?
           Globs the for the files matching the pattern in the current
           directory.  If a pattern is not specified then '.tkg2$' is
           used.  Other Tkg2 file names that are specified in the usual
           place are catenated to the globbed files.  Glob is often used
           with --walkatree to traverse down a directory for deep
           globbing.  Other filenames can be listed in place of the
           pattern.  Most Perl regular expression syntax is supported 
           and regular shell regular expression syntax is not.
     
     --height=<X.X inches>
           Specify the page height for all Tkg2 files on the command
           line.  The margins of each plot and the coordinates of each
           annotation and explanation are altered according to the
           relative location or percentage from the origin of the
           original page height.  The page height can also be controlled
           using the Tkg2rc file with 'Tkg2*height:   4' for a 4 inch
           height.  The command line option will override height values
           seen in the Tkg2rc file.  Also, only the last occurrence of
           Tkg2*height in the Tkg2rc file is used. 
     
     --help [optional topics]
           This help.  When additional topics are provided, Tkg2 launches
           the tkpod reader.  'pod' stand for plain old documentation.
           Tkg2 appends a '.pod' to the topic name and looks in the
           Tkg2/Help/ directory for the file to markup.  Tkg2 files can
           still be loaded from the command line if they end in '.tkg2'.

             --- Utilities to improve your life ---
             
             GeneralUtilities
                 Utilities that are of a general nature to aid in file
                 parsing and other activities.  All the utilities are
                 contained in the Tkg2/Util directory.
             
             NWISUtilities
                 Utilities specific to the U.S. Geological Survey NWIS
                 system or specific to USGS job needs.  All the
                 utilities are contained in the Tkg2/Util directory.
               
     --home=<directory path>
           Set an alternative home directory for Tkg2 interaction with
           the file system.  When unspecified, the home directory
           becomes the directory in which Tkg2 was launched.       
     
     --importdata
           Toggles a global variable, which specifies whether or not
           Tkg2 is to delete the loaded data whenever a given Tkg2
           file is saved.  A Tkg2 file that normally uses dynamic
           data loading can be copied to a file with hard loaded
           data like this: 
           % tkg2 -importdata --stdout \ 
                  -autoexit test.tkg2 > test_hardload.tkg2
           --importdata also is very important for a client-server
           type model of operation with Tkg2.  For example,
           % tkg2 --importdata \
                  --stdout --autoexit test.tkg2 | tkg2 --stdin 
           pipes test.tkg2 after loading of data to another Tkg2
           process.  Without the --importdata, then the second
           Tkg2 process would need access to the files specified by
           test.tkg2 for its dynamic loading.  The option became 
           obvious because of the need for Tkg2 to work in
           unidirectional communication with itself on other
           machines on the network.
          
     --inst=<file name | - >
           Instructions, an extremely powerful scripting mechanism
           to make changes to plots, datasets, data, reference lines,
           quantile-quantile lines, and line, symbol, and test
           annotation without resorting to using the mouse.  This
           option can be repeated.  If the file name contains a
           directory patch, then it will have to be quoted.
           See the Instructions.pm module for details. If one
           of the invocations of inst is '-', such as '--inst=-'
           then the Instructions will also be read from STDIN to
           that pipe and redirections are supported (at least on
           Unix).  The Instructions are read once and only applied
           at the last second before graphics begin rendering.
           See --redoinst if a run-time dynamic Instruction session
           is desired.  The Instructions are really quite simple,
           but do not underestimate their power.
      
     --instv=<file name | - >
           A verbose version of --inst along STDOUT.  The --verbose
           option needs to be set for --instv to actually show output.
           --instv is handy for debugging Instruction files. 
           
     --instb4data
           Instructions before the data.  This option places the call
           into the Instruction algorithms before the call into the 
           dynamic data loading algorithms.  The default behavior is
           for the Instructions to be executed immediately following
           the loading of the data.  This execution sequence prevents
           the Instructions from modifying how a data file is read
           in.  For example, perhaps the data file delimiter has
           changed from a tab to a comma.  The presence of this
           option cause the Instructions to be executed immediately
           before the loading of the data.
           
           Until the 0.72 release (Jan 6, 2002) and greater of Tkg2,
           this option was not available.  Tkg2 has grown up with the
           Instructions executed after the data is loaded only.
           Because there are some wild (to say the least) things
           going on behind the scenes, it is uncertain whether the
           --instb4data option might cause unexpected problems.
           None are know of at the present time however.  Please
           exercise the option will careful testing and provide your
           author some important feedback.
     
     --justdisplay
           Turns Tkg2 into a multiple *.tkg2 file displayer in which
           the user can only print to postscript or create MIF files
           or simply exit each file using the Tkg2 Displayer menu->exit.
           The Exit button on the main dialog totally exits the session.
           A special SaveAs menu selection is provided in which the
           display only Tkg2 file can be saved with the data hard
           loaded into the new file name.  This new file can then
           be shipped around and plotted without the concern of
           having to ship the data files too.
                            
     --justdisplayone
           Turns Tkg2 into a multiple *.tkg2 file displayer in which
           the user can only print to postscript or create MIF files
           or totally exit the entire session.  The --justdisplayone
           is poorly named as multiple files are displayed but
           the exit from the Tkg2 Display menu does a total exit.
           A special SaveAs menu selection is provided in which the
           display only Tkg2 file can be saved with the data hard
           loaded into the new file name.  This new file can then
           be shipped around and plotted without the concern of
           having to ship the data files too.

     --mkplot=<string of margins, #x#x#x#>?
           Specifies the left, right, top, and bottom margins in inches
           for a plot.  This option is used in optional conjunction with
           --mktemp, and can be repeated to build multiple plots.  For
           example, --mkplot=1x1x1x5.5 --mkplot=1x1x6x1.5 creates two
           plots on the template, as specified by --mktemp.  Each plot
           has side margins of 1 inch.  The first plot has a top margin
           of 1 inch and a bottom margin of 5.5 inches; whereas, the
           second plot has a top margin of 6 inches and a bottom margin
           of 1.5 inches.  Either lower or upper case 'x' is used to
           delimit the string.  After each plot is created, a dialog box
           asking for data is provided for convenience.  Consult the
           pre-built page generation scripts in Tkg2/Util/PreMades,
           which are documented in GeneralUtilities.
           
     --mktemp=<dimension string, #x#>
           Specifies that a template is to be generated on the fly with
           the width and height, in inches, specified in an 'x' delimited
           string.  For example, to create a typical letter sized template
           in portrait orientation --mktemp=8.5x11.  Either lower or upper 
           case 'x' can be used to delimit the string.  Only one --mktemp
           is recognized at a time.  If the sister command, --mkplot is
           not used then default plot margins are used instead.  After
           each plot is created, a dialog box asking for data is provided
           for convenience.  Two short aliases are provided for quick
           creation of 8.5x11 and 11x8.5 templates, 'l' (8.5x11) and 'p'
           (11.8.5) for letter and portrait, respectively.  Consult the
           pre-built page generation scripts in Tkg2/Util/PreMades,
           which are documented in GeneralUtilities.
     
     --megacmd_args=<string>
           Additional arguments can be passed to any and all
           megacommands called during a single Tkg2 session.  Underscores
           (_) can be used to separate a list of arguments.  The
           underscores are stripped and replaced with a single space
           prior to the execution of the command.  For example,
           --megacmd_args=-help_3 would add '-help' and '3' to the
           command.  Use the --megacmd_show options to see how the
           arguments are applied and the results of the command.  The
           --verbose option provides a similar output to see what
           command is built, but does not report the output of the 
           command.  The --verbose option might be a preferred option
           to debug megacommands.  It is unlikely in the future
           that you will be able to pass differing arguments to 
           different commands.  The megacommand itself is specified
           instead of a data file from the 'Advanced' tab of the
           AddDataToPlot dialog box.
          
     --megacmd_keep
           Override the default behavior of deleting all generated
           megacommand files when the Tkg2 process exits.  The list of
           megacommand files are kept in the $::TKG2_ENV{-MEGACMD_FILES}
           array and the basename of the files is kept in the 
           $::TKG2_ENV{-MEGACMD_BASENAME} scalar.  A megacommand file name
           looks something like the following: 'Tkg2_megacommand_file_1'.
           
     --megacmd_show
           Provides a verbose reporting of the output of the megacommand
           or megacommand pipeline by cat-ing the command output to STDOUT
           using a system() call.
     
     --message=<string>
           A user specified string identify the calling script or other
           pertinent information for easier reading of the /tmp/tkg2.log
           file.  For example, suppose the script go.pl called Tkg2
           via a system call like this
           
             tkg2 --message="go.pl_is_the_parent"
           
           Then then string "# go.pl is the parent" would be
           placed as the final entry on a line of the | delimited 
           tkg2.log file.  Underscores are used to signify spaces and
           will be stripped away before the line is written to the
           log file.  When present --message is used by --presenter as
           the dialog box title; short messages are preferred because
           of visible dialog box title space limitations.  See
           --dumpboxes for another use of the --message option.
     
     --nobind
           Instructs Tkg2 to not construct mouse bindings on the canvas.
           This is a handy feature because one can run Tkg2 in
           --justdisplay, --justdisplayone, and --presenter display
           modes in which the bindings used in regular interactive
           sessions are left on although the menus are very limited.
           So with --bind, the user sees a limited interface, but is
           able to make adjustments to the graphics without having
           to save them and then relaunch Tkg2.  When --nobind
           is set, then all the mouse bindings are removed.  If
           --nobind is used without the presence of --justdisplay,
           --justdisplayone, or --presenter, then the --presenter mode
           is turned on.  This avoids potentially confusing situations
           for the user because a regular interactive session is seen
           yet the mouse is incapable of interacting with the drawn
           objects.
           
     --nodec
           Removes all window decorations from the Tkg2 template window.
           The window can not be minimized, closed, or even moved by the
           window manager.  Tkg2 still retains control of the window,
           however.
     
     --nodialogrescale
           Normally Tkg2 rescales the font sizes seen in dialog boxes
           so that the text is readable no matter what the scaling
           factor on the drawing window is.  Because Tkg2 is tinkering
           with what the user seen, it is felt that having this option
           to turn this behavior off might be useful in some very
           rare and odd technical support cases.
     
     --noexport
           Disables the exporting of the Tkg2 file into another format by
           removing the "Export" function from the File or Tkg2 Displayer
           menu in the upper left hand corner.
     
     --nofieldcheck
           Per line and per column field checking is not performed during
           loading of data.  In other words, numbers should be numbers,
           time should be time, and strings are everything else. For
           large files this can provide a significant speed increase.
           Tkg2 might throw run-time errors instead of politely providing
           error trapping and an error dialog box.
     
     --nomenus
           Disables the display and of course compiling of the menus that
           are displayed along the top of a Tkg2 canvas.  The option can
           be used with or without the --justdisplay, --justdisplayone, or
           --presenter options.  When --nomenus is given, --noundo and
           --nobind are toggled on.  This option is useful if you
           absolutely do not want the user to be able to modify the 
           plots or anything else.
     
     --nomw
           Withdraws the main dialog box or technically the Tk MainWindow.
           The main dialog box is the small horizontally oriented 
           window containing just the buttons for New, Open, View ENV, and
           others.  The option --withdrawmw does the same thing.  The
           Exit action, which exits a single Tkg2 template as opposed
           to the Exit Tkg2 action, is not shown when the --nomw is
           used.  This is so that the user can not be left with a
           running Tkg2 process yet now windows to close to kill the
           process.  Further when used inconjunction with the
           --justdisplay, the Total Exit from Tkg2 Displayer window
           (the MainWindow) is not shown.  The Exit in the the TKG2
           DISPLAYER menu does a total exit from Tkg2 even if more than
           one Tkg2 file is open.

           A further feature of the --nomw option is that if the close
           toggle on the window decoration (usually an "X"-looking glyph)
           is clicked then tkg2 is exited entirely.  The close toggle is
           almost always in the upper right hand corner of the window.
           Tkg2 windows that were opened by the same process as the
           clicked window will naturally be destroyed.  This is an
           important feature because it prevents a forked Tkg2 process
           from hanging indefinitely. For example, the Perl command
               
               print `tkg2 -nomw frequency.tkg2 boxplots.tkg2`;
           
           will not wait forever as the following command would
           
               print `tkg2 frequency.tkg2 boxplots.tkg2`;
           
           if the user managed to minimize the six-button main dialog,
           forgets that they did this, and then closes the frequency.tkg2
           window by clicking on the close toggle of the window decoration.
           Both frequency.tkg2 and boxplots.tkg2 will be closed
           simultaneously as the tkg2 process quits.  This behavior is
           equivalent to clicking on the close toggle of the six-button
           main dialog box of Tkg2--all children tkg2 sheets will be 
           exited.

     --noprint
           Disables postscript printing of the Tkg2 file by removing the
           "Print" and "Print and Exit" functions from the File or
           Tkg2 Displayer menu in the upper left hand corner.
     
     --norulers
           Turns the rulers off, which saves noticeable time on drawing
           a Tkg2 file.  Hence, if you require just a bit more speed
           and do not think that the rulers are needed, then use this
           feature.
     
     --nosave
           Disables saving or creating Tkg2 files by removing the "Save",
           "SaveAs", new "New" functions from the File or Tkg2 Displayer
           menu in the upper left hand corner.
           
     --noundo
           Turns the undo feature off, which saves a few seconds of
           drawing time on a Tkg2 file.  Hence, if you require just a bit
           more speed and no undo, then use this feature.  The speed
           increase comes from not needing to clone the template (the Tkg2
           file) in memory.
                
     --nozoom2unity
           Turns off the default behavior that the --zoom is set to unity
           during postscript rendering.  This option will change the
           corresponding checkbutton on the Exporting and Printing dialog
           box.  Nozoom2unity can be set to true (or even false) through
           the Tkg2rc file with 'Tkg2*nozoom2unity:  #' where # is 1 for
           truth or 0 for false (default anyway).  The command line option
           will override Tkg2rc file.
		
     --optimize
           Adds the following to the command line options:
              --nofieldcheck, --norulers, and --noundo.        
     
     --pause=<integer>
           After processing each file, Tkg2 will sleep(integer) seconds
           before moving on to processing the next file. 

     --presenter
           Turns Tkg2 into a powerful multiple *.tkg2 file displayer
           in which a scale widget appears and allows the user to
           interactively control which of the Tkg2file(s) given by
           the command line will be plotted.  One figure at a time
           is display through the Tkg2 Displayer.  A special
           SaveAs menu selection is provided in which the display
           only Tkg2 file can be saved with the data hard loaded
           into the new file name.  This new file can then be shipped
           around and plotted without the concern of having to ship
           the data files too.  Note that --autoexit and similar do
           not work with the Tkg2 presenter.

     --presentercolumns=<integer>
           Specifies the number of columns that Tkg2 is to show in the
           presenter dialog box.  The excess or remainder files are
           packed into the far left grooved frame; this is hard wired.

     --presenterlabels=<string, delimited by :>
           Replaces the Tkg2 file names next to the radiobuttons in
           the presenter frame with the labels provided by this option.
           The ordering of the labels matches the ordering of the Tkg2
           files specified.  A colon (:) is used to delimit between
           the different labels.  If an entry is not provided for each
           of the Tkg2 files, then Tkg2 uses the string
           "no label provided" instead to prevent undefined value 
           warnings.  The option will internally toggle --presenter.
           In order for proper parsing of the string on the option,
           please use underscore (_) in space of each space.  Tkg2
           will perform an _ to space substitution with the presenter
           frame is built up.

     --presentersort
           Sorts the Tkg2 file names.  Tkg2 does not assume that the
           user desires alphabetical sorting unless told to do so.  This
           permits someone to script Tkg2 in the presenter mode and be
           assured what order the files are in; a useful feature for
           training classes.

     --pretty_data **                    NOT IMPLEMENTED YET
           Dumps data from *.tkg2 files after any necessary dynamic
           loading in an attractive row column format.

     --printer_queue=<string>
           Set the printer queue.  This is a work around on the
           different printing mechanisms.  For example, if you use
           'pdq' instead of 'lp' to handle print jobs, then say
           --printer_queue=pdq.  The printer queue can also be
           set using the environment variable PRINTER_QUEUE.  The
           default is to use 'lp -c', which is on most Unix variants
           though Linux uses 'lpr'.
     
     --readonly
           Short cut for toggling of --noexport, --noprint, and
           --nosave.  Consult the description of those options.
           One can still modify the canva unless the --nobind option
           is separately provided.
     
     --redodata  Redo the deletion and reloading of all dynamically
           or run time loaded data.  Meaningless unless some of the
           data was not imported into the Tkg2 file.  Redoing the
           data loading turns Tkg2 into a highly flexible application
           extension tool and real-time data visualization tool.  If
           the data has changed after the data was loaded, then the
           redo will update the plots with the new data.  Because
           all internal data is deleted first, some protection against
           memory overruns is provided at the expense of update speed.
           When --redodata is operational a small vertical button
           that performs the data deletion, reloading, and drawing
           update is placed next to the File menu.  The button is
           yellow when only the --redodata option is set.  The button
           is red when both --redodata and --redoinst are set.
           
     --redoinst  Redo the --inst or --instv with every update of the
           canvas.  Meaningless unless used in conjunction with 
           one or more --inst or --instv.  Redoing the --inst turns
           Tkg2 into a highly flexible application extension tool
           because outside applications can alter -inst files even
           after the entire template has been drawn for the first
           time.   When --redoinst is operational a small vertical
           button that updates the canvas is placed next to the
           File menu.  The button is light blue when only the 
           --redoinst option is set.  The button is red when both
           --redoinst and --redodata are set.  Finally, it is hoped
           that future versions of Tkg2 will support some sort of
           signaling mechanism by which external processes can tell
           Tkg2 to update the canvas.
     
     --relative_paths or --norelative_paths **    NOT IMPLEMENTED YET
           Toggles entire *.tkg2 files to use relative_path names.
     
     --scaling=<real no. > 0>
           Alters the start up scaling constant of Tk (and Tkg2) by
           multiplying the constant by the option number.  So if
           -scaling=0.9 is used, then the scaling constant of the
           whole Tkg2 session is 10 percent smaller.  The scaling
           constant represents the number of pixels per point where
           point is 1/72 of an inch.  This switch can make it easier
           to use Tkg2 on a low resolution monitor.  Tkg2 does have
           some limited built rules to alter scaling dependent on 
           the host resolution (see Tkg2/Base.pm, ResolutionHandler).
           Another way to control the scaling constant is to add
           an entry in one of the Tkg2rc files, 'Tkg2*scaling 0.9'.
           The scaling value is used in place of the built in rules,
           but is overridden by the command line option.  A value
           of zero can be used within the Tkg2rc file to toggle
           the scaling setting back to the built in rules without
           having to delete or comment out a line from the Tkg2rc
           file.
           
     --showme=<real no. > 0>
           Traces program execution subroutine by subroutine by echoing
           to standard error.  The real number is the 10ths of seconds
           to pause the program with each echo.  The massively repeated
           subroutines and anonymous subroutines are not traced.  The
           following is an example of the --showme output.
           
           ## Tkg2::Base::routeBUG
           ##   from /usr/local/bin/Tkg2
           ##   on line 625
           ##-2-args    undef 0
 
           #### Benchmark: Tkg2::Base::routeVERBOSE to beginning of
           ####            Tkg2::Base::routeBUG took:
           ####  0 wallclock secs ( 0.00 usr +  0.00 sys =  0.00 CPU)
           
           
     --showmesubs
           Shows just the subroutine name, file origin, and line number
           in that file calling the subroutine. The option is used in
           conjunction with --showme and does not toggle --showme by
           itself.  The information is reported along standard error.
           The following is an example of the --showmesubs output.  
             
             Tkg2::Base::routeVERBOSE \ 
             FROM /usr/local/bin/Tkg2.pl (623)     
            
           Subroutine name is Tkg2::Base::routeVERBOSE.
           File containing that subroutine is /usr/local/bin/tkg2.pl.
           Line number in file is 623.          
           
     --splash or --nosplash
           Toggles a SPLASH filehandle to either /dev/null or
           /dev/stderr.  Every module in Tkg2 prints to the SPLASH
           filehandle when it is first compiled by Perl.  The SPLASH
           filehandle is a mechanism by which the user can see that
           Tkg2 is actually doing something.  SPLASH can also be
           controlled using the Tkg2rc file(s) and toggling the
           -SPLASH key.
           
     --stdin
           Read the Tkg2 file along standard input (STDIN).  To avoid
           getting Tkg2 confused between --inst=- and --stdin, Tkg2
           ignores --inst=- when --stdin is used.  STDIN is read for
           only a single Tkg2 file and then only after all other files
           specified on the command line have been read in.
           
     --stdout  
           The last Tkg2 file read in and displayed is dumped out along
           STDOUT.  This feature allows a server to run Tkg2 and then
           feed output to a client running Tkg2.
     
     --test=<integer>
           Sets up a testing situation by showing the *.tkg2 files
           for the specified number of seconds until a total exit.
           
     --time_cache_delete
           Instead of retrieving the saved time cache hash from
           ~Tkg2/Time/TimeCache/storable_time_cache, the file
           is deleted.  It will be recreated upon exiting Tkg2
           unless the --time_cache_ignore switch is also run.
           
     --time_cache_ignore
           The presence of the time cache file is ignored entirely.
           It is neither retrieved at startup or saved as the Tkg2
           process dies.  The ~Tkg2/Time/TimeCache/storable_time_cache
           file remains untouched.
     
     --time_cache_nosave
           Does not perform a save on the time cache during program
           exit.  Any additional date/times learned by Tkg2 will be
           lost.  This is a handy feature to get a little more speed
           when one does not care whether Tkg2 remembers new 
           date/time combinations or knows that the time cache was
           unchanged by the program.
           
     --time_cache_view
           The key value pairs of the time cache hash are viewed.
           The switch is only used during normal time cache retrievals
           at startup.  Be prepared that the time cache can be a very
           big hash, but no harm is done if the view switch is used.
     
     --walkatree=<directory>?
           Walkatree identifies that a recursive search starting in
           the specified directory is to be performed.  If no
           directory is specified, then the current directory is used.
           The current directory could have been altered by --home.
     
     --verbose or --noverbose
           Turns on an off most Tkg2 messages along STDOUT.  STDERR
           is left unaltered for your convenience.     
           
     --version or --v or --V
           Prints a little message showing the Tkg2 version number,
           build date, and other useful information.      
           
     --viewconfig
           Prints out the current values of the Tkg2 environment and
           its configuration after the .tkg2rc files are processed.
     
     --width=<X.X inches>
           Specify the page width for all Tkg2 files on the command line.
           The margins of each plot and the coordinates of each
           annotation and explanation are altered according to the
           relative location or percentage from the origin of the
           original page width.  The page width can also be controlled
           using the Tkg2rc file with 'Tkg2*width:   4' for a 4 inch
           width.  The command line option will override Tkg2rc file
           values of width.  Also, only the last occurrence of
           Tkg2*width in the Tkg2rc file is used.
           
     --withdraw
           Uses the Tk method withdraw to not display the main tk canvas
           at all.  However the user DISPLAY must still be set as Tk
           requires a connection to the X-server.  Research by the
           Tkg2 user community has turned of the Xvfb screenless
           X frame buffer.  They are reporting that Xvfb can be use
           Tkg2 in cron jobs.
     
     --withdrawmw
           See --nomw.
     
     --zoom=<real no.>
           Poorly named, --zoom is a multiplier on font sizes
           created by Tkg2 when rendering text on the canvas.  --zoom is
           a neat feature to use in combination with --width or --height.
           A regular pagesize (8.5x11) can easily be enlarged to say
           20x20 and the fonts will be disproportionately small unless
           zoomed by say by a factor of 2 (--zoom=2).  Zoom can be
           controlled by the Tkg2rc file with 'Tkg2*zoom:  real no.'.
           The command line option will override Tkg2rc file values of
           zoom.  Like many other options, only the last value seen in the
           tkg2rc file is used.
