Tkg2 (birthdate May 15, 1999) is a full featured, interactive, and batch processing capable 2-D charting package modeled after the venerable USGS-G2 (circa 1990s), which sadly few now remember and fewer lament. Tkg2 is entirely written in Perl and the Tk graphics module. Other nonstandard Perl modules are required and can be acquired from http://www.CPAN.org. Tkg2 features include: linear; log; normal and Gumbel probability; time series; x, y and x-y error bar; x, y, and x-y error limit; bar, and text plots.  Other plot types include remarkably flexible boxplots, x- or y-accumulator plots, and time variation plots.  Other features include nearly unlimited ASCII file input types, hard loading or run-time loading of data, and use of absolute or relative path names in the input data files.  Exported graphics formats include Portable Network Graphics (PNG), Portable Document Format (PDF), Postscript, and a METAPOST to LaTeX subsystem also is available to access full-feature typesetting capabilities.  Nearly eighty command line options are available and an external instruction language to control Tkg2 objects is provided to support scripting and application glueing.  Tkg2 has a fantastic array of cool and unique features built because only the user base as suggested which features should be included.  Tkg2 might be rough on the edges, but it is extremely stable and very powerful. Tkg2 has been used as a workhorse for data visualization and has seen a roughly estimated usage rate, not including that of the author, of (9 years) * (365 days) * (about 45 Solaris NWIS installations) * (200 times per day [low est. from Texas NWIS system]) = perhaps 30 million executions! TKG2 IS STABLE SOFTWARE.
